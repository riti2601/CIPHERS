# Caesar Cipher

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts characters in a string by a certain number of positions.

## Current Implementation

### Caesar Cipher
- **Encryption:** The program takes input data and shifts each character by a user-defined number to encrypt the data.
- **Decryption:** It also allows you to decrypt data by reversing the shift, returning the original message.

## Future Plans
I plan to extend this repository with more encryption and decryption techniques, as well as other interesting algorithms in Java.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```
3. **Compile the Java file:**
    ```bash
    javac caeserCipher.java
    ```
4. **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    java caeserCipher
    ```
